                    This is a story . . . about Kevin Bacon, and how he saved a small town with dancing. Just kidding. This is a story about Jeff Miller, my father.
                He grew up in a christian household<br> with a loving family and was outnumbered, seeing as he was the only boy with three sisters. Even though he was 
                from a small town in Indiana he wasn't afraid to chase his dreams. <br>My father loved riding motocross and bicycles. He even worked in a bike shop when 
                he was still in high school. He loved cars, racing and my mom.

            <p> 
                    My parents met in high school and were very good friends, but before they were married they would write letters to each other while they were apart during college. Back then they <br>didn't have texting or email, and most of the letters
                were written in cursive. Often times my father would write little messages in the small spaces of a card and draw in his own pictures <br>that usually had nothing to do with the contents of the letter. 
                His humor was very witty and full of inside jokes. Some of his letters were written on calanders or what ever was available <br>at the time. One of the envelopes had a ten cent stamp and five one cent stamps.
                I like to think he did that on purpose just to be obnoxious. Then my mother would write back  
                on construction <br>paper with words cut out of newspapers and magazines like a randsom letter. They adored eachother and their letters made that obvious.

            <p>
                    If you are unfamiliar with who Nicki Lauda was than look up the movie Rush. Niki Lauda was my father's favorite Formual 1 race car driver. He always loved cars and racing. 
                    He used to <br>race motocross bikes. His dream came true when we moved to virgina so that he could work for Bob Tullius' IMSA race team, Jaguar 44. He got to travel all over Europe and the US.
                    <br>My father built the engine of the Jaguar XJR-5 and was a mechanic for them. He also got to be a part of the pit crew. He loved it but after having three kids he quit that 
                    so he could be <br>home more and became a tool and die maker.

                His work was across town from where we lived in Missouri, but he still rode his bike to work everyday. My dad had a work bench in the basement and I remember him working on his<br> 
                    bikes down there. He even made his mountain bike frame from scratch and built it up. He is the reason I got into biking.
